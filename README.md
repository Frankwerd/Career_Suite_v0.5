# Career Suite v0.5 **REVISED PROJECT NAME**
# job-tracker-parser-simulator
A Dockerized Node.js environment to locally test and debug the email parsing functions (job_application_email_parser.gs) by simulating the Google Apps Script environment (GmailApp, SpreadsheetApp). Companion tool for the Automated Job Application Tracker repo.

# Job Tracker Parser Simulator (Dockerized)

## Overview

This project provides a local, Dockerized Node.js environment designed specifically for **testing and debugging the core email parsing logic** used in the main [Automated Job Application Tracker & Pipeline Manager](https://github.com/Frankwerd/Automated-Job-Application-Tracker-Pipeline-Manager/) project.

The primary goal is to simulate the Google Apps Script environment (`SpreadsheetApp`, `GmailApp`) locally, allowing you to run the parsing function (`processJobApplicationEmails`) against various predefined email scenarios without needing live Gmail/Sheet interactions or waiting for Apps Script triggers. This enables rapid testing, refinement of parsing rules (keywords, regex), and validation of how the script handles different email types (new applications, updates, rejections, interviews, offers).

## How it Works

This Node.js script:

1.  **Mocks Google Services:** It includes mock implementations of `SpreadsheetApp`, `GmailApp`, `MockSheet`, `MockThread`, and `MockMessage` classes that mimic the essential methods used by the original parser script (e.g., `getSheetByName`, `getThreads`, `getMessages`, `appendRow`, `getRange`, `addLabel`, `removeLabel`).
2.  **Contains Parser Logic:** It incorporates the core logic from the `job_application_email_parser.gs` script, adapted slightly to work within the Node.js/mock environment. This includes functions for extracting company/title, parsing status keywords, and interacting with the mock sheet/labels.
3.  **Sets Up Test Data:** It initializes a `mockSheet` array (simulating the Google Sheet) and defines functions (`addPreExistingApplications`, `createTestCases`) to populate the sheet with existing data and create mock email "threads" with various subjects, senders, bodies, and dates.
4.  **Executes the Parser:** The `runSimulation()` function orchestrates the setup and calls the adapted `processJobApplicationEmails()` function.
5.  **Outputs Results:** It logs detailed information to the console during execution, showing how emails are processed, how the mock sheet is updated or appended, and the final state of the mock sheet and labels.
6.  **Runs in Docker:** A `Dockerfile` is provided to containerize the Node.js environment and the script, ensuring consistent execution regardless of your local setup.

## Relation to the Main Project

This simulator was built as a companion tool for the [Automated Job Application Tracker & Pipeline Manager](https://github.com/Frankwerd/Automated-Job-Application-Tracker-Pipeline-Manager/).

*   It uses the **same core parsing algorithms and configuration constants** (column numbers, status keywords, label names etc.) defined in the `job_application_email_parser.gs` script from that repository.
*   It allows you to **test changes or additions to the parsing logic** (e.g., adding new keywords, improving regex) locally *before* deploying them to the live Google Apps Script environment.
*   By observing the console output, you can **verify exactly how the script interprets different emails** and updates the simulated spreadsheet, helping to debug issues found in the live tracker.

## Prerequisites

*   **Docker:** You need Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux) installed and running on your machine. Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/).

## Setup & Running with Docker

Follow these steps to run the simulation locally:

1.  **Clone This Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [URL of THIS simulator repository]
    cd [simulator-repository-directory-name]
    ```
    *(Replace placeholders with your actual URL and directory name)*

2.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    Navigate to the repository's root directory (where the `Dockerfile` is located) in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    docker build -t job-parser-simulator .
    ```
    *   `docker build`: The command to build an image from a Dockerfile.
    *   `-t job-parser-simulator`: Tags the image with a memorable name (`job-parser-simulator`). You can change this tag if you like.
    *   `.`: Specifies that the build context (including the `Dockerfile` and necessary code files) is the current directory.
    *   **What this does:** Docker reads the `Dockerfile`, sets up a Node.js environment inside the image, copies the necessary script files into it, and potentially installs any Node.js dependencies (if you add a `package.json` later).

3.  **Run the Simulation Container:**
    Once the image is built successfully, run the simulation using:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it job-parser-simulator
    ```
    *   `docker run`: The command to create and start a container from an image.
    *   `--rm`: Automatically removes the container when it exits (keeps things tidy).
    *   `-it`: Runs the container in interactive mode and allocates a pseudo-TTY, allowing you to see the `console.log` output directly in your terminal.
    *   `job-parser-simulator`: The name/tag of the image you built in the previous step.
    *   **What this does:** Starts a container based on your image. The `Dockerfile`'s `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` instruction (likely `node runSimulation.js` or similar) will execute the main simulation script inside the container.

## Expected Output

When you run the container, the detailed processing logs will appear first. The **final summary output** showing the state of the mock spreadsheet and labels should look similar to this: 

## === SIMULATION RESULTS ===

**Final spreadsheet rows:** 6

**Spreadsheet Data:**

| Company         | Job Title           | Status              | Email ID                  | Last Update Date |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| TechCorp        | Senior Developer    | Rejected            | update_techcorp_reject_1  | MM/DD/YYYY       |
| Beta Corp       | Data Analyst        | Interview Scheduled | update_betacorp_interview_1 | MM/DD/YYYY       |
| Gamma Inc       | Backend Engineer    | Assessment/Screening| update_gammainc_assess_1    | MM/DD/YYYY       |
| Delta Solutions | Project Manager     | Offer/Accepted      | update_deltasol_offer_1    | MM/DD/YYYY       |
| Acme Inc        | Software Engineer   | Applied             | newapp_acme_1             |                  |

**Spreadsheet Headers:**

`Processed Timestamp | Email Date | Platform | Company | Job Title | Status | Last Update Date | Email Subject | Email Link | Email ID`

**Final Label State:**

* "JobAppToProcess" Threads: 0
* "TestAppToProcess" Threads: **5**


**Explanation of Changes in the Output Table:**

*   **Row 2-5 (Updates):**
    *   The `Status` column now reflects the status determined by the corresponding *update* email (Rejected, Interview Scheduled, etc.).
    *   The `Email ID` column now shows the ID of the *update* email (e.g., `update_techcorp_reject_1`) because that was the last email processed for that row.
    *   The `Last Update Date` column shows `MM/DD/YYYY` (representing the date the simulation *processed* the update email), as the script updates this field during an update.
*   **Row 6 (New Entry):**
    *   This row is added for Acme Inc.
    *   The `Status` is the default (`Applied`).
    *   The `Email ID` is that of the *new* application email (`newapp_acme_1`).
    *   The `Last Update Date` is initially blank for new entries according to the script logic.
*   **Label State:**
    *   `JobAppToProcess` should have 0 threads, as all test emails were successfully processed and moved.
    *   `TestAppToProcess` (or your configured 'done' label) should have 5 threads, one for each processed test email.

*(Note: The exact `MM/DD/YYYY` in the output will be the date the simulation script ran, reflecting the `processedTimestamp`)*

## Customizing Test Cases

To test different email scenarios or parsing rules:

1.  **Modify Existing Cases:** Edit the email subjects, bodies, senders, or dates within the `createTestCases()` function in the main script file (e.g., `runSimulation.js` or equivalent).
2.  **Add New Cases:** Add more calls to `new MockThread(...)` within `createTestCases()`, ensuring you give them unique IDs and add them to the `mockLabels["JobAppToProcess"].threads` array.
3.  **Modify Pre-existing Data:** Adjust the entries added in the `addPreExistingApplications()` function to test updates against different initial sheet states.
4.  **Rebuild & Rerun:** After making changes to the script, you'll need to rebuild the Docker image (`docker build -t job-parser-simulator .`) and then run the container again (`docker run --rm -it job-parser-simulator`).

## Dockerfile Example

Ensure you have a `Dockerfile` in the root of this repository. A basic example:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
# Using node:18-alpine as an example; choose a version suitable for your code
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the script file into the container at /usr/src/app
# !! IMPORTANT: Replace 'your_main_simulation_script.js' with the actual name of your main Node.js script file !!
COPY your_main_simulation_script.js ./
# If you have helper files in subdirectories (e.g., ./lib), copy them too:
# COPY lib ./lib

# Specify the command to run on container start
# !! IMPORTANT: Replace 'your_main_simulation_script.js' with the actual name of your main Node.js script file !!
CMD [ "node", "your_main_simulation_script.js" ]
```

*(Remember to replace your_main_simulation_script.js with the correct filename in the COPY and CMD lines above).*
